# MyPiggy - automated expense tracker

MyPiggy seeks to make life easier and convenient by automating the process of tracking expenditure. The app calculates the amount by reading the text message, and adding to the specific category, so the user can figure out their debit balances while making an online payment.

If a user makes an offline purchase but fails to add the correct amount, the app will prompt them to do so. Depending on the user's location, the alert will ask if they have spent money in the area) The user is also given the option of setting goals for a specific time frame for certain categories, and the app summarizes their spending for the day and assists them in maintaining an economical lifestyle.
